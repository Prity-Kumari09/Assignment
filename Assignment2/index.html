        <h1>BLOSSOM OF THE CHERRY TREE</h1>
        <p class="tag-line">Cherry Blossom Trees bring billowy pink and white blooms in the spring. These blooms often last no more than two weeks and are also a symbol of renewal and the ephemeral nature of life. </p>

        <p class="intro">LThe Okame Cherry Tree is an early bloomer with medium pink petals, while the Kwanzan Cherry Tree opens in late spring with deep pink flowers. The Yoshino Cherry Tree has wide-spreading branches with white blooms that are replaced by glossy green leaves in the summer. Pink and White Weeping Cherry Trees combine an elegant weeping form with a dramatic cascade of flowers on branches that spill downwards. You should select a cherry blossom tree based on the qualities most important to you and the parameters of your garden. If space is limited, consider a Dwarf Cherry Blossom Tree.Cherry Blossom Trees need lots of sunlight and soil that is rich and fertile, check the growing zone recommended for your species of Flowering Cherry. Experts suggest choosing a spot in the garden or yard that provides at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. The soil beneath your flowering tree should also have good drainage for proper growth. Flowering Cherry Trees can grow anywhere from 15 to 30 feet high with a canopy just as wide, so choose a location that can support the tree's mature size.Only water the tree during prolonged dry periods of the summer. Cherry Blossom Trees do not like sitting in soggy soil. Feed the tree once per year with a general granular fertilizer in the spring.
